## Randopt
Randopt is a Python package for machine learning experiment management, hyper-parameter optimization, and results visualization.
It is in active development and I -- as well as others -- have been using it for every machine learning project since November 2016.
You can install it with `pip install randopt`.

## Tooski.ch
Tooski is the largest francophone website dedicated to the Ski World Cup.
There, you'll find news and blogs related to the Swiss Ski Team, the FIS World Cup circuit, as well as some younger skiers.
Tooski began as an adventure in merging two of my passions: computers and skiing.

## Python Performance Tuner
The Python Performance Tuner (PPT) is a Python toolbox to help you benchmark and tune your Python scripts.
Currently in active development, it is available in beta via pip: `pip install ppt`.
An official open-source release will happen when the tool has matured.

<br />

## Paperify & Plotify
A tool to convert markdown files into beautiful LaTeX docs, web pages, and presentations.
And another one to make beautiful graphs, plots, and charts from an intuitive API.
A work in progress, available in beta via `pip install paperify` and `pip install plotify`.

[[Web Demo](http://seba-1511.github.io/config/), [PDF Example](http://seba-1511.github.io/summaries/discrete_mathematics/dm.pdf)]

In the Summer of 2017, Theo Denisart (mostly) and I spent some time designing and programming a 3D-printed robotic cat for reinforcement learning, while at the ValeroLab.
What makes Kleo special is that its limbs are actuated via tendons -- making it robust to failures but difficult to control.
Matt Simon brilliantly covered our work in his WIRED article.
