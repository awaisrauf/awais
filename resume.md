# Interests

* **Ski**: Throughout my highschool and part of my university studies, I was lucky to race across the Alps on the FIS circuit with the best regional Swiss skiers. This longstanding passion spawned Tooski, and I was once ranked among the best 2'000 racers worldwide.
* **Mathematics**: I am generally interested in mathematics, and more specifically in optimization and stochastic models. I like to apply them to all kinds of problems, especially the ones related to artificial intelligence.
* **Computing**: I have been programming since the age of 14, and have studied different computational hardwares such as GPUs, D-Wave, and HPC Clusters.
