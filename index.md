I am an undergraduate student at the [University of Southern California](http://www.usc.edu), double majoring in Computer Science and Math. My research interests lie in [artificial intelligence](http://valerolab.org/), distributed systems, and [mathematical optimization](http://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/msl/).

I also like skiing ([a lot](http://www.tooski.ch)).

# News

#### SoCal ML Symposium submission
Our paper on comparing TRPO with CEM was accepted as a poster presentation. Congratulations to Elizabeth Chu !

#### Summaries
I recently published some of the summaries I made through my studies. All of them written with paperify.py. Work in progress. [[Available here](http://seba-1511.github.io/summaries/)].

# Projects
<!--<br />-->
<!--<a ng-href="http://seba-1511.github.io/config/" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary btn-xs">Know More</a>-->

### Paperify.py
A tool to convert markdown files into beautiful LaTeX docs and web pages. A work in progress. [[Web Demo](http://seba-1511.github.io/config/), [PDF Examples](https://github.com/seba-1511/config/tree/master/tex_templates/examples)]

### Specialists
Code for the report "A Greedy Algorithm to Cluster Specialists", where I develop an algorithm for the class assignment problem in the generalist-specialist framework. [[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/seba-1511/specialists)]

### Quantum Opt
Comparing the performance of simulated annealing against a simulation of adiabatic quantum computing on Ising problems. [[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/seba-1511/quantum_opt)]

### Tooski
Simply the best skiing website ever ? [[Website](http://www.tooski.ch/)]

### ML Compare
Compare machine learning algorithms on the same dataset, with only one line. It is distributed across your cores ! [[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ZebTech/MLCompare)]

### Meritocracy
A web-based social experiment to evaluate the meritocracy of people. [[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/seba-1511/meritocracy)]

### Generatic Experiment
Making neural networks and standard machine learning algorithms learn from artificially generated images. Images are generated with a genetic algorithm, out of a convolutional neural network. [[GitHub Repo](http://github.com/ZebTech/geneticExperiment)]

### Tea Stock Market
Predict the fluctuations of Indian Tea Companies' stock market, based on weather data. A lot of machine learning, some financial analysis. [[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/seba-1511/stockMarket)]
