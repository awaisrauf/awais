I am an undergraduate student at the [University of Southern California](http://www.usc.edu), double majoring in Computer Science and Math. My research interests lie in [artificial intelligence](http://valerolab.org/), distributed systems, and [mathematical optimization](http://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/msl/).

I also like skiing ([a lot](http://www.tooski.ch)).

#### Open-Sourcing randopt
I open-sourced [randopt](https://seba-1511.github.io/randopt/), a [python package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/randopt) to streamline the search for good hyper-parameters. An effort to be [continued](https://github.com/seba-1511/randopt).

# Projects

### randopt
Randopt is a python package to streamline the search for good hyper-parameters. It provides a programmatic interface to serialize, choose, and visualize hyper-parameters and results. [[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/seba-1511/randopt), [Blog Post](https://seba-1511.github.io/randopt/)] 

### Paperify.py
A tool to convert markdown files into beautiful LaTeX docs and web pages. A work in progress. [[Web Demo](http://seba-1511.github.io/config/), [PDF Examples](https://github.com/seba-1511/config/tree/master/tex_templates/examples)]

### Specialists
Code for the report "A Greedy Algorithm to Cluster Specialists", where I develop an algorithm for the class assignment problem in the generalist-specialist framework. [[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/seba-1511/specialists)]

### Quantum Opt
Comparing the performance of simulated annealing against a simulation of adiabatic quantum computing on Ising problems. [[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/seba-1511/quantum_opt)]

### Tooski
Simply the best skiing website ever ? [[Website](http://www.tooski.ch/)]

### ML Compare
Compare machine learning algorithms on the same dataset, with only one line. It is distributed across your cores ! [[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ZebTech/MLCompare)]

### Meritocracy
A web-based social experiment to evaluate the meritocracy of people. [[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/seba-1511/meritocracy)]

### Generatic Experiment
Uses a genetic algorithm to generate images out of a trained convnet. Also, tries to learn from the generated images only. [[GitHub Repo](http://github.com/ZebTech/geneticExperiment)]

### Tea Stock Market
Predict the fluctuations of Indian Tea Companies' stock market, based on weather data. A lot of machine learning, some financial analysis. [[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/seba-1511/stockMarket)]
